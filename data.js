But a new study of nine people who contracted the virus in Germany suggests that people are mainly contagious before they have symptoms and in the first week of the disease.</p><p>Infectious viruses were isolated from about 17 percent of nose and throat swabs and more than 83 percent of phlegm samples during that first week, researchers report March 8 in a study posted at medRxiv.org.</p><p>Patients produced thousands to millions of viruses in their noses and throats, about 1,000 times as much virus as produced in SARS patients, Clemens Wendtner, director of infectious disease and tropical medicine at Munich Clinic Schwabing, a teaching hospital, and his colleagues found.

And as much as we love seeing UFC fights from Brazil with no fans, the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Basketball: A Love Story</em><span>&nbsp;</span>documentary and wall-to-wall coverage of the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/TomBrady/status/1239895697207549952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL player movement</a>, we think you can do better. We know you can do better.</p><p>(Even during these surreal times, no government has issued restrictions on obnoxious sports fan opinions.)</p><p>Below, TIME presents our list of 10 classic sports contests we&rsquo;d love to see rebroadcast in full, as we seek to distract ourselves during quarantine. Note: this is no list of the greatest sporting events of all-time. No, these are 10 things we just want to watch.</p><p>We do realize that ESPN may not own the rights to rebroadcast some of these events. To that, we humbly reply: so what? Go out and get them. We&rsquo;re in a national emergency. Networks and sports bodies can surely work together to fill our collective sports void.</p><p>The good news: most of this stuff is available on YouTube anyhow. So to the fans, we say, ESPN or no: enjoy.</p><p>The game was all but over. In the 121st minute, America was down by a goal and down a player. Brazil, after stalling and collapsing from phantom injuries over and over, controlled the ball deep in the corner of American territory.</p><p>What happened next was<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2013/12/18/abby-wambachs-stoppage-time-strike-edges-landon-donovans-winner-vs-algeria-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted the best moment</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in U.S. soccer history: a perfectly executed set of passes that ended in Abby Wambach heading in a pitch-perfect cross from Megan Rapinoe. Rapinoe later said she had no idea whether or not there was a teammate in the box when she launched it, but that she just had to give her team one final opportunity. The ball sailed past the outstretched arms of Brazil&rsquo;s keeper Andr&eacute;ia and right onto Wambach&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;The stadium shook. It was absolute pandemonium,&rdquo; Rapinoe<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/the-cross" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalled three years later</a>.</p>',
